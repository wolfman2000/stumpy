[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wolfman2000/stumpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wolfman2000/stumpy)

This is version 3.4.0 of the tracker, meant to be inspired by crossproduct's excellent tracker. Please see & support his work at [twitch.tv/crossproduct](https://twitch.tv/crossproduct).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Features

* Ability to track via the mode. Do you dare take on Swordless Mode?
* Ability to set the difficulty. No need to worry about accidentally setting the golden sword here.
* Ability to set the goal. Do you want to take on all of the dungeons and bosses?
* Ability to set the Keysanity item shuffle. Do you want to explore the land for keys?
* Ability to turn on a Go Mode indicator for when you can rush through dungeons.

### Planned Features

* More variation compatibility.
* Pedestal indicators.
* Saving and resetting the tracker without refreshing the browser.
* Flexible tracker layouts, whether through presets or full custom functionality.

## Releases

Any full releases can be found on the official [Stumpy website](http://stumpy.nfshost.com).

Any non pre-release is designed to work with an Apache server. Simply drop the files onto your webserver, restart it, and you should be good to go. Note that new releases will completely replace the old files due to the use of hashing.
