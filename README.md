# Stumpy, a Link to the Past Item Tracker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wolfman2000/stumpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wolfman2000/stumpy)

This is version 2.0.0 of the tracker, meant to be inspired by crossproduct's excellent tracker. Please see & support his work at [twitch.tv/crossproduct](https://twitch.tv/crossproduct).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.2.

## Features

This tracker includes one layout, with the ability to set the sword mode. The sword mode only comes into play right now if using Swordless mode.

### Planned Features

* More variation compatibility.
* Go mode/pedestal indicators.
* Saving and resetting the tracker without refreshing the browser.
* Flexible tracker layouts, whether through presets or full custom functionality.

## Releases

Any non pre-release is designed to work with an Apache server. Simply drop the files onto your webserver, restart it, and you should be good to go. Note that new releases will completely replace the old files due to the use of hashing.
